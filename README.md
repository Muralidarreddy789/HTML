     Step3:-After the <!DOCTYPE.html> comes the open html tag (<html>).The <html> is the buliding blockfor our page most of the other tags will be nested within the open html tags             in the </html>(closing html tag)
     Note:- keep in mind that an open tag must be closed to defined the ending of the html page 
     Step4:-Next comes the head tag (<head>). The <head> contains the important instruction of our browser.First,it identifies the title of the page .For this reason,the open                 title tag(<title>) enclosing title tag (</title>) must be contained within the head tags
     Step5:- Next comes the <title>.The actual title of the page should be contaned within the title tags.The title of the page is displayed on the tab od the browser
     Step6:- Next comes the Meta tags
